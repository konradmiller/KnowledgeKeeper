~ fix "filter":
   - tags, pdfs, notes, authors, title should be searchible via whoosh
   - add possibility to manually re-index
   - add possibility to modify index (note changed -> toss old index for note, add new one)

~ remove treeview

~ scale/move DAG

~ search for documents that are cited by the selected document

~ export/import for backup and database changes

~ add possibility to limit the nodes in the DAG view

~ ah change in the paper data should be a change in the database, not a re-add

~ add multiple dois for one document

~ use saved dois and don't research

~ tagcloud

~ cluster dag: conference, year, etc

~ attach other files (slides, pix, links, etc)

~ bibtex generation

~ fingerprint papers and search a db for metadata

~ use data in pdfs to fill out metadata
